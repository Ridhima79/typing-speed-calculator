# Typing Speed Test App

This is a simple web-based **Typing Speed Test** app that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy for different time intervals. The app provides a random paragraph and gives you options for 1-minute, 2-minute, or 3-minute tests. It calculates your **Words Per Minute (WPM)**, **accuracy**, and **mistakes** after completing the test.

## Features

- **Three test durations**: 1-minute, 2-minute, and 3-minute options.
- **Real-time feedback**: Displays words per minute (WPM), typing accuracy, and the number of mistakes.
- **Word-by-word display**: The typed words are compared against the target text, and each word is color-coded as **correct** or **incorrect**.
- **Random Paragraphs**: The app randomly selects a paragraph for each test.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for the app.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for handling the typing test, timer, WPM calculation, and user interaction.
